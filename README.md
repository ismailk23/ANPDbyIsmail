Automatic Number Plate Detection (ANPD) Project
Overview
This Python project leverages OpenCV and EasyOCR libraries for Automatic Number Plate Detection (ANPD). The application takes an input image, converts it to black and white, crops it to the number plate region, and reads the number using OpenCV and EasyOCR. The results are displayed on the original image using Matplotlib for image processing.
Add the image you want to process to the project folder.
Run the program and enter the path or name of the image when prompted.
